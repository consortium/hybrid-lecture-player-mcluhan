The Hybrid Lecture Player is a new open source platform release that allows you to turn lecture documentation into a multi-format publication.

The case study focuses on the long-running video documentation of an insightful lecture by the historian and curator Graham Larkin on Marshall McLuhan’s own experimental publishing and media practice. The player unpacks the lecture’s sections to transform it into a hybrid lecture environment that reveals the knowledge contained in the video in exciting ways, encouraging users to watch it further and engage with McLuhan archives.

The Hybrid Lecture Player is part of a broader investigation on publishing and engagement with archives that we have called, 'Traces on the Archive'. Traces refers to the users activity in the archive, highlighting the hidden parts of the archive, and the visitor’s journey through a collection. In addition to making multimedia content practically available through digital technologies, such as the Hybrid Lecture Player, the study also develops concepts that provide a variety of methods and examples of how to access and activate an archive.

## Roadmap

https://research.consortium.io/docs/traces_on_the_archive/traces_on_the_archive.html#next

1.  Hybrid Lecture Player Demo Release - the initial demo is to act as a testing prototype for reflection and further design to work on: interfaces, how to augment media and technical implementations for mobile; web; tablet; and print publishing.
2.  Hybrid Lecture Player - Open Source Release - the Open Source release allows testing of two parts of the framework: a) How to design the framework as a minimal setup for someone to add shorter video work, and b) To gauge the feasibility for an editor to create their own publication, which involves editing the time code files to sync text, video and external links.
3.  Multi-format Publishing - there are two main goals. To release the Hybrid Lecture Player as a software framework and as a module of the larger A-machine publishing ecosystem. Produce prototype research publication for the development of processes, methods and case studies. There will be an emphasis on the Hybrid Publishing Consortium’s model of interoperability, standards, design methods and working with existing Open Source expert projects.
4.  McLuminations 2011 - an accompanying publication by Steffi Winkler and Baruch Gottlieb covering the 2011 McLuminations series. This demo publication would focus on the eBook format and the Transpect multi-format publishing software workflow.
5.  Archive Digitization - full archive collection management and compatibility with the A-machine structured data multi-format publishing framework. This includes examples such as: Heidelberg Research Architecture tools, including Tamboti, Pandora and Scanning; and Data Futures’ Freizo software for asset management. All of the above in accordance with VRA/MODS US Library of Congress metadata compliant standards and using controlled vocabularies.
6.  Collaborative Publishing Layers - Traces on the Archive publishing tool kit combines two closely related models of publishing Archive Architectures and the Dynabook. Some practical examples of publishing functionality are: A. Social media bookmarking, B. Playlists, C. Authoring new content, D. The scholar's note book and archive tracer. This also envisages case studies of ‘publishing from the archive’ in the Open Education Resources (OER) sector.

### About the Hybrid Publishing Consortium

This Case Study is a project by the Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC), a research project with a mission to support the development of open source software for public infrastructures in publishing. HPC pursues a model of digital interoperability, frameworks as opposed to platforms, that combines ISO standards with experimental approaches to dynamic publishing, using existing Open Source expert projects.  
HPC develops concepts for new forms of access to information, and specializes within their research in Museums, Libraries and Archives publishing.  

Funded by the EU major project Innovation Incubator Lüneburg.  
Hybrid Publishng Consortium develops open source software infrastructures for publishing and is part of the Hybrid Publishing Lab at the Centre for Digital Cultures, Leuphana University, Lüneburg, Germany and is funded by the European Union and the German federal State of Lower Saxony.
